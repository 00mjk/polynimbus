# Overview

Polynimbus is a multi-cloud infrastructure management tool. It allows full lifecycle, fully automatic management of Linux-based cloud instances, using the same syntax and semantics, supporting all important cloud computing vendors:

- Alibaba Cloud
- Amazon Web Services
- Beyond e24cloud.com
- Google Cloud Platform
- Hetzner Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud
- Rackspace Cloud

All supported vendors are well tested with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, and also are expected to work without major problems with any recent Debian or Ubuntu version).


## Why Polynimbus?

Polynimbus hides all semantic differences between all supported cloud platforms and provides you a simple, clean and consistent API to deploy and manage Linux cloud instances.

## Installation

Polynimbus has to be installed exactly into `/opt/polynimbus` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/polynimbus/polynimbus /opt/polynimbus
/opt/polynimbus/install.sh
/opt/polynimbus/api/v1/account/setup.sh yourvendor youraccount
```

where:
- `yourvendor` is one of: `alibaba`, `aws`, `azure`, `e24`, `google`, `hetzner`, `oracle` or `rackspace`
- `youraccount` is the name of your configured account (or region name in case of `azure`)

Once you finished the initial setup, you can always manually edit files inside `/etc/polynimbus` directory to make sure that your vendor is properly configured.

Additional notes:

1. `azure`, `google` and `oracle` vendor drivers support having only one account configured at the same time, however `azure` allows operating on each region as separate pseudo-account.

2. For `azure` and `google`, the setup process needs browser interaction.

3. For `rackspace` vendor driver, the configuration process will ask you for a Profile Name. Polynimbus works only with named profiles, not with the default nameless profile, so you have to type some non-empty name there, even if you use only one Rackspace account.

4. `alibaba` vendor driver doesn't support creating and deleting instances yet, and listing existing instances works only in full details mode.

5. `oracle` vendor driver requires manual installation of OCI client software (details [here](drivers/oracle/README.md)).


## Example usage

### Creating new cloud instance

```
/opt/polynimbus/api/v1/instance/create.sh aws prod_account prod_key1 m5.2xlarge
/opt/polynimbus/api/v1/instance/create.sh azure eastus testkey2 Standard_A2
```

Hostname of the new instance will be written on console, as soon as it's ready for provisioning.

### Listing all configured accounts and cloud instances

```
/opt/polynimbus/api/v1/all/list.sh
```
